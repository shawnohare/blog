My name is Shawn Michael O'Hare and I am a 
mathematician, data scientist, and skeptic.
Broadly, I am interested in the applications of 
mathematics---specifically abstract algebra---to
machine learning, statistics, artificial intelligence, and 
data science.  

The writings on this site represent an eclectic mixture of my
interests.  Generally the articles aim to please 
a mathematically sophisticated audience while still being informative
to a lay reader.
