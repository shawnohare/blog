My name is 
[Shawn Michael O'Hare](https://plus.google.com/115904086044687543049)
and I am a
mathematician, data scientist, and skeptic.
Broadly, I am interested in the applications of
mathematics---specifically abstract algebra---to
machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence.

The writings on this site represent an eclectic mixture of my
interests.  Generally the articles aim to please
a mathematically sophisticated audience while still being informative
to a lay reader.
