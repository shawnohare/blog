I am Shawn Michael O'Hare, a mathematician and data scientist.
Broadly, I am interested in the applications of mathematics to
machine learning, statistics, artificial intelligence, and 
data science in general.  

The writings on this site represent a slightly more eclectic mixture of my
interests, such as skepticism.  Generally the articles aim to please 
a mathematically sophisticated audience while still being informative
to a lay reader.
