I am a mathematician, [data scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), and
[skeptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement).  Broadly, I am
interested in the applications of mathematics---specifically abstract
algebra---to machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence.

The writings on this site represent an eclectic mixture of my
interests.  Generally the articles aim to please
a mathematically sophisticated audience while still being informative
to a lay reader.
