## Init

Clone the repository, create a `themes` dir in the root, clone the desired
theme repositories (such as github.com/shawnoahre/hugo-morphism), get hugo,
then build the site.

## Deployment

We uitlize the 
[git-directory-deploy](https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy)
script to deploy the generated site to the
[Github Pages](https://github.com/shawnohare/shawnohare.github.io)
repository. Our vendored version of the deploy script resides in the
`bin` directory, together with it's config file.
