## Init

The site includes the theme as a submodule, so all dependencies
can be fetched via:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/shawnohare/site
```
Clone the repository, create a `themes` dir in the root, clone the desired
theme repositories (such as github.com/shawnoahre/hugo-morphism), get hugo,
then build the site.
